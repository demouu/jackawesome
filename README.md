# jackawesome is for Homework 1. Changed a lot of the <div></div> tags to be more semantically correct. E.g. changing <div></div> tags containing classes like "footer" to be <footer></footer> tags. Same applied to the main body, now being <main></main> tags, as well as the 'sidebar' being encased with <aside></aside> tags.

# Also changed a lot of the id's containing redundant CSS into classes. Such as if the id CSS contained the exact same information as another id, they were compressed into a class to reduce redundant code.

# Made sure the Title was accurately resembling the Webpage.
